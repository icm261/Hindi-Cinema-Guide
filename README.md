### Built With

HTML, CSS, and Javascript

This project began as a basic site to showcase my ability to code in vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Therefore, I chose not to use frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind, React, Vue, etc. 

The entire project is currently hard-coded. The film details and images need to be manually updated. There are future plans to scale the site to include database calls.

### Installation

To install and run the site locally:

1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
```
2. Open index.html in your browser
